The competition had 6,134 participants, and organizers received 10,276 works (drawings and photographs). The childhood dream of the young artist Sofiia Kravchuk about a happy future for Ukraine is connected with the winged \"Mriia\". In Sofiia's drawing, the world's largest and most powerful aircraft, the An-225 \"Mriia\", decorated with pink flowers, flies to the stars. Unfortunately, during the war on the territory of Ukraine, the legendary Ukrainian aircraft was destroyed. The enemy destroys Ukrainian equipment and ruins settlements, but it cannot destroy WILL and the desire of Ukrainians for FREEDOM, it cannot destroy the UKRAINIAN DREAM. And the plane, we Ukrainians will certainly rebuild and welcome it again in Kyiv at the parade in honor of Ukraine's Independence Day!",

On February 24, 2022, Russia began a new stage of the eight-year war against Ukraine - a full-scale offensive that has already lasted 6 months. Unexpectedly, the invaders encountered enormous resistance from Ukrainians. Thanks to the resistance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and self-defense forces, the Russian army suffers huge losses in manpower and equipment every day. And although the enemy launches massive missile and bomb strikes on peaceful Ukrainian cities and villages every day, committing genocide against the Ukrainian people, the nation remains unconquered. In the struggle for freedom, Ukrainians show incredible heroism, patriotism, resilience, and love for their homeland, each in their place, contributing their crucial input to Victory. With the postal issue \"FREE. UNBROKEN. UNCONQUERED\" we honor Ukrainians who have become true heroes for the whole world!",

    "description": "Hryhorii Skovoroda is a powerful thinker, an interesting writer, an extraordinary personality any European culture would be proud of. He was born in the urban-type settlement of Chornukhy (Poltava Region). He studied at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. He preferred personal spiritual freedom - led an ascetic lifestyle and spent much time traveling. Among the creative legacy of Hryhorii Skovoroda are philosophical works and collections of songs and fables (\"Garden of Divine Songs\", \"Kharkiv Fables\"). Skovoroda's sayings, mainly about ethics, became very popular: \"Love arises from love...\", \"Do what you were born to do...\", \"...care is the movement of the soul, and life is movement\", and so on. Many collections of aphorisms were compiled from them. His authorial phrase - \"The world tried to catch me, but did not\" - has become especially relevant today, since the philosopher was not \"caught\" by Russian aggressors either. On May 6, 2022, Russian troops hit the building of the H.S. Skovoroda National Literary and Memorial Museum in the village of Skovorodynivka (Kharkiv Region) with a missile, where the thinker lived and worked in his later years. Although the building was severely damaged and burned inside, authentic items of the museum collection related to Skovoroda's life and work were preserved. The philosopher's statue also survived.

    "description": "Hryhorii Skovoroda is a powerful thinker, an interesting writer, an extraordinary personality any European culture would be proud of. He was born in the urban-type settlement of Chornukhy (Poltava Region). He studied at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. He preferred personal spiritual freedom - led an ascetic lifestyle and spent much time traveling. Among the creative legacy of Hryhorii Skovoroda are philosophical works and collections of songs and fables (\"Garden of Divine Songs\", \"Kharkiv Fables\"). Skovoroda's sayings, mainly about ethics, became very popular: \"Love arises from love...\", \"Do what you were born to do...\", \"...care is the movement of the soul, and life is movement\", and so on. Many collections of aphorisms were compiled from them. His authorial phrase - \"The world tried to catch me, but did not\" - has become especially relevant today, since the philosopher was not \"caught\" by Russian aggressors either. On May 6, 2022, Russian troops hit the building of the H.S. Skovoroda National Literary and Memorial Museum in the village of Skovorodynivka (Kharkiv Region) with a missile, where the thinker lived and worked in his later years. Although the building was severely damaged and burned inside, authentic items of the museum collection related to Skovoroda's life and work were preserved. The philosopher's statue also survived.

The earliest written source where Svarog is mentioned is \"The Tale of Bygone Years\".

According to legends, she was the wife of the god Svarog and the mother of Lelia and Polel. In Slavic mythology, Lada appears as a beautiful woman adorned with roses and ears of grain. Her name is mentioned in ancient Ukrainian spring songs. The author of the issue, Ukrainian artist Mykola Kochubei, used signs in the sketches which, intertwining in the plot, turn symbols into images. Thus, in the festive women's round dance and in the swift run of horses the Svarha sign is encoded, and in the double DNA spiral - the endless movement and process of evolution.",

The author of the issue, Ukrainian artist Mykola Kochubei, used signs in the sketches which, intertwining in the plot, turn symbols into images. Thus, in the festive women's round dance and in the swift run of horses the Svarha sign is encoded, and in the double DNA spiral - the endless movement and process of evolution.",
