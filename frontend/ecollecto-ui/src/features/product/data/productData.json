The competition had 6,134 participants, and organizers received 10,276 works (drawings and photographs). The childhood dream of the young artist Sofiia Kravchuk about a happy future for Ukraine is connected with the winged \"Mriia\".

Unfortunately, during the war on the territory of Ukraine, the legendary Ukrainian aircraft was destroyed. The enemy destroys Ukrainian equipment and ruins settlements, but it cannot destroy WILL and the desire of Ukrainians for FREEDOM, it cannot destroy the UKRAINIAN DREAM.

    "description": "The greeting \"Good evening, we are from Ukraine!\" became iconic in 2022 after the Russian military invasion of Ukraine. Today these words open broadcasts by journalists, officials, and the military, and they sound in music tracks. It was the phrase \"Good evening, we are from Ukraine!\" that Ukrainians chose from among five themes presented for voting as the subject for the next wartime postage stamp of Ukraine. In the open competition for the best sketch for the postage stamp \"Good evening, we are from Ukraine!\", which received 1,500 creative works, the drawing by Anastasiia Bondarets won decisively. Overall, nearly 900,000 respondents took part in the voting. According to the author of the issue, Anastasiia Bondarets, her drawing is about how every Ukrainian does everything depending on them, to the best of their ability, to bring our Victory closer.",

    "description": "300 years of dreams of statehood; 105 years of struggle for a free Ukraine; 31 years of building independence; 8 years of defending sovereignty and borders. On February 24, 2022, Russia began a new stage of the eight-year war against Ukraine - a full-scale offensive that has already lasted 6 months. Unexpectedly, the invaders encountered enormous resistance from Ukrainians. Thanks to the resistance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and self-defense forces, the Russian army suffers huge losses in manpower and equipment every day. And although the enemy launches massive missile and bomb strikes on peaceful Ukrainian cities and villages every day, committing genocide against the Ukrainian people, the nation remains unconquered. In the struggle for freedom, Ukrainians show incredible heroism, patriotism, resilience, and love for their homeland, each in their place, contributing their crucial input to Victory. With the postal issue \"FREE. UNBROKEN. UNCONQUERED\" we honor Ukrainians who have become true heroes for the whole world!",

Her name is mentioned in ancient Ukrainian spring songs.
